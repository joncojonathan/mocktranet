    <p>
        Blue Box Limited was founded in 2001 by Penny Smithson, who's steered the company to where we are today.
        Penny was inspired by a documentary about innovative leaders and, as she was considering starting her own
        business, decided to found the company. Since opening in January 2001 the company has grown to 15 employees,
        expanded to include a customer services team, and moved to bigger offices in 2003.

        We pride ourselves on customer satisfaction. We've won many awards since our founding, including the "best
        new business" award in 2002 and we were voted "most approachable company" in 2004. To receive that award,
        Penny took the whole customer services team (then three people) to London to attend the gala dinner,
        acknowledging that without their contributions to the company our customers would not have voted for us to
        win this prestigious award.
